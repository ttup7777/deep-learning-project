# Deep-learning-project
CS4180-deep learning project

the code files of each models return the submission file (results of testing set) and roc score

text-cnn.py is corresponding to text-cnn model
pooled-gru-with-preprocessing.py is corresponding to text-cnn model 
test_LSTM_LOAD_MODEl is corresponding to LSTM model
hierarchical-attention-network is corresponding to attention+ LSTM model

validate_custom is for testing validation core
